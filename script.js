        EXAMPLE: 123 + 1231 + 121 + 1

        Capture the reference of the number buttons (0 to 9)
        Capture reference of the textbox
        Create variable that stores the first number
        Create variable that stores the operator
        Create an array of digits that is able to store more than one value when buttons are clicked
        Capture reference of the operator buttons (+-/*)
        Create an array of numbers and operators that is able to then perform arithmetic operations

        Loop through the nodelist containing number buttons
            For each number inside the nodelist (all the number buttons can be accessed), 
            1. User clicks '1', '2' and '3' buttons that belong to the nodelist of number buttons
                1. Push '1', '2', '3' to the digits array => digits = ['1', '2', '3']
