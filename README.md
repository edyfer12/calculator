# calculator

The calculator will enable the user to select numbers from 0 to 9 which are featured on the buttons, which are then displayed on the textbox. 
The buttons will also include the operators plus, minus, divide, multiply. The user will be able to press those buttons after the first number is clicked 
and before the second number is pressed. When the user is finished using the operators, they can press the equal button where the numbers between
the operators will be calculated and the final result will be shown on the text box. The text box is read-only so the result cannot be altered
by the user. The decimal point button is also included where the number is aimed to be floating point instead of integer. The user is however
not allowed to press the decimal button again once is clicked as that will not get displayed on the text box. If the user divides the first number
by zero, the error message will be shown on the text box, 'Number cannot be divided by zero' and encourage the user to reenter the operations. 
Finally, the clear button is featured on the calculated, where if the user clicks the first number and decides to clear, the first number displayed
is blank. In another case, if the user selects the first number and the operator button followed by the clear button, the first number is cleared
from the text-box and the operator gets removed in the process of operation. The user is then able to re-enter the first button and operator.
